# Mux Embed

The core Mux Javascript SDK and HTML5 Video Element tracker.

## Using

Install the package:

`npm install mux-embed`

Include mux-embed where needed:

`import mux from 'mux-embed';`

## Using directly in an HTML page

The above directions are for including within an NPM project. If, however, you want to include the script file directly in a website, make sure that you use the `/node_modules/mux-embed/dist/mux.js` file in your `<script>` tag.
